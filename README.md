# Tides Rider BIOS

BIOS for the Tides Rider MSX computer, including support for Balrog, the Z280 card. Work in progress and in a very early stage of development, a lot of stuff not implemented yet and nothing has been tested so far.

You need [Nestor80](https://github.com/Konamiman/Nestor80/) (including Linkstor80) and the standard Linux `make` (Windows user? [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) is your friend) to build the BIOS ROM. Other than that, for now your best source of documentation for this BIOS is the code comments themselves.
